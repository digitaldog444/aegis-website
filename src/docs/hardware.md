## üß∞ Wiring Diagram

```txt
+--------------------+
|  Raspberry Pi 4    |
|                    |
|  GPIO 17 ‚Üí Pan Servo (MG995)        |
|  GPIO 18 ‚Üí Tilt Servo (SG90)        |
|  GPIO 27 ‚Üí Trigger/Fire Relay       |
|  GND      ‚Üí All components (common) |
|  5V       ‚Üí Servo power rail (low load) |
+--------------------+

    For higher torque motors, use external 5V/6V supply and a MOSFET or relay to isolate Pi.

üî© Mechanical Assembly
1. Pan/Tilt Mount

    Use an L-bracket or printed turret base

    Pan servo at the base, tilt servo on top

    Attach camera and payload to tilt plate

2. Payload Mounting

    Design a modular mounting plate (e.g., 3D printed)

    Use M3 screws or servo horns

    Payloads can be swapped dynamically with plug-in headers

3. Housing

    Use laser-cut acrylic, aluminum extrusion, or printed PLA/ABS

    Weatherproofing optional for outdoor use

üîã Power Recommendations
Component	Typical Current	Notes
Pi 4	~0.6A idle, ~2A full load	Use official 5V 3A PSU
MG995 Servo	~500mA per move, peak 2A	Use 5-6V external PSU
Camera	~250mA	Powered from Pi

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't power large servos directly from the Pi 5V rail. Use a UBEC or separate supply.

üß™ Testing Hardware

Test servos with Python:

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)
servo = GPIO.PWM(17, 50)
servo.start(7.5)

# Sweep left-right
for angle in [5, 7.5, 10, 12.5]:
    servo.ChangeDutyCycle(angle)
    time.sleep(0.5)

üß± Modular Expansion
Port / GPIO	Expansion Idea
I2C	OLED screen or IMU
SPI	LoRa radio
UART	GPS or telemetry
GPIO	LEDs, triggers, alarms
USB	Flashlight, secondary cam
